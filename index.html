                <h2>
                    What is Multiple Intelligence Theory?
                </h2>
                    <p>Multiple intelligence theory was created by Harvard professor of Education Dr. Howard Gardner (waterford.org). The theory challenged previous conceptions of intelligence assessment. Gardner found the standard IQ test flawed and, instead, theorized that there are eight intelligences that “that people use to solve problems and create products relevant to the societies in which they live” (Seider, edutopia.org). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The eight intelligences are:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>linguistic,</li>
                            <li>logical,</li>
                            <li>musical,</li>
                            <li>spatial,</li>
                            <li>bodily-kinesthetic,</li>
                            <li>interpersonal,</li>
                            <li>intrapersonal, and</li>
                            <li>naturalistic (https://brainconnection.brainhq.com/).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Teachers can and should design lesson plans and assessments that celebrate each of these eight intelligences, rather than privileging a select few.
                    </p>
                <h2>
                    What is Cooperative Learning?
                </h2>
                    <p>The book <em>Cooperative learning in the Classroom</em> defines cooperative learning as, “the instructional use of small groups through which students work together to maximize their own and each other’s learning” (Johnson et al 4). The principles of cooperative learning assume that group learning is being executed sixty-to-eighty percent of the time and students must believe they are being graded collectively rather than individually (Johnson et al 4-5).      
                    </p>
                    <p>Cooperative learning enables students to not only develop academic skills but also social skills (Sharan 1). Furthermore, cooperative learning benefits diverse levels of subject matter competency and learning styles (Sharan 1).</p>
                <h2>
                    Strategies for Addressing Multiple Intelligence Theory and Utilizing Cooperative Learning
                </h2>
                    <p>
                    Differentiated instruction is a technique that allows teachers to support multiple intelligences within the classroom. Differentiated instruction technqiues like providing student choice on assessment materials means students are able to demonstrate their learning in the format that best fits their skillset (Finely, edutopia.org).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Providing student choice can also be a cooperative learning technique. For instance, giving students the option to work in groups means they can engage with cooperative learning principles. Likewise, a cooperative learning activity that requires groups to solve a multi-faceted problem can also be differentiated for different levels of competency and learning styles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    An example of this could be a group project that has a speaking component, a visual component, and a written component. A student with high intrapersonal intelligence could focus on the writing, while the visually intelligent student can create the visuals. Finally, the student with high interpersonal intelligence could deliver the presentation. Thus, cooperative learning, multiple intelligence theory, and differentiation are all inlcuded in one assignment.
